This repo contains an implementation of the following [paper](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/math.2024617)
for the [Crash prediction challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nexar-collision-prediction) on Kaggle.

A Vision Transformer (ViT) is trained to predict vehicle-collision time from a collection of real world traffic videos provided by [Nexar](https://www.getnexar.com/) dashcams.
